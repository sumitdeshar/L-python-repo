 I moved the file alice.txt to the correct directory, so the try block will
 work this time. We take the string contents, which now contains the entire
 text of Alice in Wonderland as one long string, and use split() to produce
 a list of all the words in the book ❶. Using len() on this list ❷ gives us a
 good approximation of the number of words in the original text. Lastly, we
 print a statement that reports how many words were found in the file. This
 code is placed in the else block because it only works if the code in the try
 block was executed successfully
