# AssertionError
#  When an assert statement fails, the AssertionError is raised.

#  AttributeError
#  When an assignment fails, the AttributeError is raised

#  EOFError
#  When the last word of the file is reached and the program attempts to 
# read any further, the EOFError is raised.

#  FloatingPointError
#  This exception is raised when floating point operations fail.

#  ImportError
#  If the import statement written in the code cannot load the said module, 
# this exception is raised. This is same as the ModuleNotFoundError in 
# the later versions of Python.

#  IndexError
#  When the sequence is out of range, this exception is raised.

#  KeyError
#  If in a dictionary the key is not found, then this exception is raised.

#  OverflowError
#  Note that each data type can hold some value and there is always 
# a maximum limit to what it can hold. When this limit is reached, the 
# OverflowError is raised.

#  RecursionError
#  While executing a code that uses recursion, at times maximum iteration 
# depth is reached. At this point in time, the recursionError is raised.

#  RuntimeError
#  If an error occurs and it does not fall in any of the said categories, then 
# this exception is raised.

#  StopIteration
#  If one is using the _next_() and there are no more objects that can be 
# processed, then this exception is raised.

#  SyntaxError
#  When the syntax of the code is incorrect, this exception is raised. For 
# example, not writing the import statements or any such thing.

#  IntendationError
#  When incorrect use of indentation is done, then this exception comes up.

#  TabError
#  An inconsistent use of spaces or tabs leads to this type of error.

#  SystemError
#  If some internal error is found, then this exception is raised. The excep
# tion displays the problem that was encountered due to which the excep

#  NotImplementedError
#  If an object is not supported or the part that provides support has not 
# been implemented, then the NotImplementedError is raised.

#  TypeError
#  If an argument is passed and is not expected, the TypeError is raised. 
# For example, in a program that divides two numbers entered by the user, 
# a character is passed, then TypeError is raised.

#  ValueError
#  When an incorrect value is passed in a function (or an attempt is made 
# to enter it in a variable), the ValueError is raised. For example if a value 
# which is outside the bounds of an integer is passed then this exception 
# is raised.

#  UnboundLocalError
#  This exception is raised when a reference is made to a variable which 
# does not have any value in that scope.

#  UnicodeError
#  This is raised when errors related to Unicode encoding or decoding 
# come up.

#  ZeroDivisionError
#  The division and the modulo operation has two arguments. If the second 
# argument is zero, this exception is raised.
